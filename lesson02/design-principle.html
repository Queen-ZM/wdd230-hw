            <p>
                Google is the center of all the internet, it is the place that
                people go to surf the net (Meaning to navigate through the world wide website
                or internet), the google web page is one of the greatest example of whit space as
                it has a clean, this page has the basic role of white space this allows
                the design breath by reducing the amount of text and functional elements
                that users see at once.

            <h3>Alignment</h3>

            <h4>Takealo</h4>
            <a target="#" href="https://www.takealot.com/">takealot.com</a>

            <p>
                This is Takealot website and we can see the principle of alignment
                there. Alignment brings order to elements and connects them, making
                content more organized and easier to view. On this site, due to the
                alignment,in the screenshot above we see how the page has a lot of elements
                even so due to Alignment all the elements come's together well for the viewer.

            <p>
                Color palette generator website are site that I believe
                show the Hick's Law as they present so many options just
                for one color making it difficult for one to decide.
